 <b>Motivation is the desire to act in service of a goal.</b> It's the crucial
  element in setting and attaining our objectives. Motivation is one of the
  driving forces behind human behavior. It fuels competition and sparks social
  connection. Its absence can lead to mental illnesses such as depression.
  Motivation encompasses the desire to continue striving toward meaning,
  purpose, and a life worth living.
